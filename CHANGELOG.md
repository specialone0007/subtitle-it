# Changelog

## Unreleased

- When no usable subtitle file exists on disk or on OpenSubtitles, the run
  makes one from the film's own speech with Whisper (`scripts/transcribe.py`),
  the last resort. Translators are told the text may be misheard, and the
  report says the subtitles came from the audio.
- A film given by path from a folder that is not in your media folders adds
  that folder, so later runs find films there by name
  (`sources.py remember`). A film in its own folder adds the folder above it.
- When no film matches, the run names any media folder that was not there,
  such as an unplugged drive, instead of only saying nothing was found.
- Step 2 also reads subtitle files in a `Subs` or `Subtitles` folder beside
  the video, up to two levels down, where a film's subtitles often sit
  (`Subs/English.srt`, or numbered subtitle files in a subfolder). Before, only files
  next to the video and named after it were found, so the run fell back to
  OpenSubtitles.

## 0.3.0

- A second reader answers the bible's questions blind, and a judge settles
  any difference from the cited cues (`scripts/bible.py`, step 5 of the skill).
- A normal run no longer asks anything after setup. It asks only which film
  you mean when the name matches several different films.
- Out-of-sync subtitles are shifted to match the audio, and the voices are
  matched again.
- `assemble.py check` warns when a line uses sen where the bible gives siz,
  or the reverse.
- `report.md` ends with "Check after watching", and the chat message has no
  spoilers.
- CI runs the tests, lint and format checks on Linux and Windows.

## 0.2.0

- Audio hints: a voice per cue from the film's audio, and a check that the
  subtitles are in sync with it (`scripts/speakers.py`).
- Each script saves its JSON result to a file, so output filters in the
  shell cannot cut it.

## 0.1.0

- First version: find the film and its source subtitles, build the film
  bible, translate in parallel chunks, check, review and deliver.
- Learn mode turns your edits into rules for the next film.
